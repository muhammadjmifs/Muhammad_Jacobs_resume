        <!-- Add 3 paragraphs about myself - passions, work studies etc -->
        <p>I am Muhammad Jacobs, born and raised in Johannesburg, Gauteng. Having a keen interest in business I persued a Bachelor of Commerce Degree
          from the University of the Witwatersrand. I knew that if I wanted to go into business having Accounting and Taxation majors would always assist me.<br><br>
          While studying I went on to learn Web design on the side as I always had an inclination towards technology and e-commerce. I started taking on projects for friends and family and learning Wordpress.
          This grew my interest in building websites and allowed me to learn further. I have a deep passion for travelling and visitng different countries.<br><br>
          I come from a family of Software developers mainly specialising in Point of Sale and Warehouse Management Systems.
          With the advancement of programs moving more towards web applications and e-commerce becoming a necessity for businesses 
          we had a gap in our company to advance our web department. This is where I stepped in and joined the company in order to provide assistance to the Web Department as well as put my Accounting and Taxation 
          knowledge to use by managing the Finance department.<br><br>
